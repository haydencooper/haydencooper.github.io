### Ingredients

- Canola Oil, 250g
- White Onion, 200g
- Garlic Clove(s), 50g
- Chiles de Arbol, Dried, Stemmed and Seeded, 5g
- Tomato(es), Quartered, 400g
- Kosher Salt, As Needed

### Steps

1. In a 3-Quart Saucepan, combine oil, onion, garlic, and chiles. Set over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion turns pale golden around the edges, about 5 minutes.

2. Add tomatoes, and reduce heat to medium. Cover, and cook at a simmer until tomatoes just begin to soften around the edges, about 5 minutes.

3. Carefully transfer contents of the saucepan to the jar of a countertop blender. Blend on high speed until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute.

4. Transfer salsa to a heatproof container, and set aside to cool at room temperature. Once salsa has cooled to room temperature, season with salt to taste, and serve.

### Storage
Leftover salsa can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.
